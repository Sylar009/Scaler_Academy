Problem Description
Construct a binary number having A 1's followed by B 0's. Return the decimal value of that binary number.
For eg -
A = 3, B = 2
Answer = (11100)2 . Return = 28


Problem Constraints
1 <= A + B <= 30


Input Format
The first argument is a single integer A.
The second argument is a single integer B.


Output Format
Return a single integer that is the decimal value of the converted binary number.


Example Input
Input 1:
A = 3
B = 2
Input 2:

A = 2
B = 3


Example Output
Output 1:
28
Output 2:

24


Example Explanation
Explanation 1:
The output 28 which is 11100 in binary with 3 one's followed by 2 zero's.
Explanation 2:
The output 24 which is 11000 in binary with 2 one's followed by 3 zero's.


Answer ::

int Solution::solve(int A, int B) {
    return ((1<<(A)) -1 ) << B;
}
