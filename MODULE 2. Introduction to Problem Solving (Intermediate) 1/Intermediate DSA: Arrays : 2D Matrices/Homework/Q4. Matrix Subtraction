Problem Description

You are given two integer matrices A and B having same size(Both having same number of rows (N) and columns (M). You have to subtract matrix B from A and return the 
resultant matrix. (i.e. return the matrix A - B).

If A and B are two matrices of the same order (same dimensions). Then A - B is a matrix of the same order as A and B and its elements are obtained by doing an
element wise subtraction of A from B.


Problem Constraints

1 <= N, M <= 103

-109 <= A[i][j], B[i][j] <= 109



**Input Format**
There are 2 lines in the input
Line 1 ( Corresponds to arg 1 ) : 2 D array. First 2 integers R, C are the number of rows and columns. Then R * C integers follow corresponding to the rowwise 
numbers in the 2D array.
Line 2 ( Corresponds to arg 2 ) : 2 D array. First 2 integers R, C are the number of rows and columns. Then R * C integers follow corresponding to the rowwise
numbers in the 2D array.


Output Format

Return a 2D matrix denoting A - B.



Example Input

Input 1:

3 3 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
3 3 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
Input 2:

1 2 1 1 
1 2 2 


Example Output

Output 1:

 [[-8, -6, -4],
  [-2, 0, 2],
  [4, 6, 8]]
Output 2:

 [[-1, -2]]


Example Explanation

Explanation 1:

 image
Explanation 2:

 [[1, 1]] - [[2, 3]] = [[1 - 2, 1 - 3]] = [[-1, -2]]
 
 
 Answer :
 
 
 vector<vector<int> > Solution::solve(vector<vector<int> > &A, vector<vector<int> > &B) {
    vector<vector<int> > result;
    for (int i = 0 ; i < A.size(); i++) {
        vector<int> temp;
        for (int j = 0; j < A[i].size(); j++) {
            temp.push_back(A[i][j] - B[i][j]);
        }
        result.push_back(temp);
    }

    return result;
}
